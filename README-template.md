## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Iâ€™ve learned how to use google to solve problems that I faced including:

- Aligning elements 
- Interesting width 
- Adjusting padding 
- Difference between main and body tags


### Continued development

I would like to become more proficient in my HTML and CSS skills before I start doing more advanced web development. As I am practicing these skills, applying the prior knowledge that I have grained from YouTube and other Self paced courses, increasing confidence in web design.
